# Samurai-Home-Buyers

-Our title is confusing.  We initianly wanted to do a home searcher but could not acquire the API, so we changed to a restaurant searcher.

-User story:  As a person who loves food, I want to be able to find the exact restaurant for myself, individuals in my life, and my family.

Team:
Mathew Sida: Team Lead and Javascript
Colton Smith: Javascript and API finder
Patrick Ryan Childers: HTML and CSS Styling


-We created a nice HTML with styling that we wanted

-We used API's from Yelp and Google Places

-We were able to minimize our HTML using JavaScript to display each restaurant. 

-We tried to add a small map next to each restaurant picture
